This is my first serious attempt at developing a game and I'm coming at this with very little experience
in managing large scale projects and no experience in game design, so my code is obviously going to be
subpar.

Development pace fluctuates depending on work and school schedules, but honestly this is more important
and interesting to me than work and school, so it often takes priority.


./nickcraft [OPTIONS]

	--texture=		name of directory storing texture atlas
	
	--seed=			seed used to generate world
	
	--world=		name of directory storing world files
	
	--maps= 		number of texture atlases, used to animate blocks
	
	--showFPS=		true or false, used to show framerate in console
	
	--render-distance=	number of chunks to load in one direction, including the chunk the camera is in.
				a render distance of 16 loads a 31x31 square.
				
	--showPos=		true or false, shows the location of the camera in the console when moving when
				set to true


Texture packs should be named and exist in a directory of the same name
Before the .png extension, there should be a number indicating the order of animation
This number is 1 for non animated packs, and for each level of animation, it increases by 1 all the way up to the --maps value

To-do:

Get this to compile on Windows so I can consolidate dependencies.
Scrap lighting (for now, terrible performance.)
Fix chunk loading bug that occurs when moving diagonally across chunk borders at high speed.
Batch rendering
Implement abstract GameObject from which chunks inherit.
Decouple OpenGL calls from game logic and object data.
