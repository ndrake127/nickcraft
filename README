This is my minecraft clone

./nickcraft [OPTIONS]

	--texture=	name of directory storing texture atlas
	--seed=		seed used to generate world
	--world=	name of directory storing world files
	--maps= 	number of texture atlases, used to animate blocks
	--showFPS=	true or false, used to show framerate in console


Texture packs should be named and exist in a directory of the same name
Before the .png extension, there should be a number indicating the order of animation
This number is 1 for non animated packs, and for each level of animation, it increases by 1 all the way up to the --maps value

I need to figure out licensing stuff to make this okay to actually make,
but until then just know I'm using the GLFW for OpenGL, STB Image Loader for loading image data,
Boost to interact with filesystem in a crossplatform way, and FastNoiseLite for terrain generation.
I will figure out how to properly credit these extremely useful libraries in a way that
is considerate of their licenses.
