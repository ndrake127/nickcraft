This is my minecraft clone



./nickcraft [OPTIONS]

	--texture=	name of directory storing texture atlas
	--seed=		seed used to generate world
	--world=	name of directory storing world files
	--maps= 	number of texture atlases, used to animate blocks
	--showFPS=	true or false, used to show framerate in console


Texture packs should be named and exist in a directory of the same name
Before the .png extension, there should be a number indicating the order of animation
This number is 1 for non animated packs, and for each level of animation, it increases by 1 all the way up to the --maps value
